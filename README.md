This project will help us learn how to build React apps and make an api call to obtain data and then utilize that data. This project is also an opportunity for us to build out a program based on user stories.

### Project Goals:

- Write a program from scratch
- Design and implement our app in React using states and props
- Implement ES6 classes
- Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with Weather Underground data.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
